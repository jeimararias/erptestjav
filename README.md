# PROJECT ERPTESTJAV
## Test requiered for Data Engineer

This project is big data migration to a new database system.   
For this challenge, a SQL SERVER database called ERPTESTJAV must be created. It contains three tables: Jobs, Departments, and HiredEmployees.   
A Rest API was developed to migrate tables from csv files. From the tables, two result reports are produced, built on views in SQL.   
Additionally, backups of the tables are obtained in AVRO format and the restore functions are obtained from the tables.   
   
### Requirements
   
  * Python 3.11.2
  * Microsoft SQL SERVER 
  * flask
  * fastavro
  * pyodbc  
  * pandas
   
### Create Database SQL SERVER
   
Before executing the migration, you must previously create the ERPTESTJAV database, through SSMS with the three tables that I list below:
> Jobs
> Departments
> Hired Employees
   
Note: If I have time, I will provide the scripts to create the database.
